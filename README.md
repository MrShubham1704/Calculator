Output of Calculator
This calculator is designed to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and provide accurate results for users. Below is a detailed description of the expected outputs based on the input operations:

1. Basic Arithmetic Operations
Addition (+)

Input: Two or more numbers.
Output: The sum of the input numbers.
Example:
Input: 2 + 3 + 5
Output: 10
Subtraction (-)

Input: Two numbers or more, with the first number as the starting point.
Output: The result of subtracting the subsequent numbers from the first number.
Example:
Input: 10 - 3 - 2
Output: 5
Multiplication (*)

Input: Two or more numbers.
Output: The product of the input numbers.
Example:
Input: 4 * 3 * 2
Output: 24
Division (/)

Input: Two numbers.
Output: The quotient of the first number divided by the second number. If the divisor is zero, the calculator returns an error or handles it gracefully depending on the implementation.
Example:
Input: 20 / 5
Output: 4
Input: 20 / 0
Output: Error: Division by zero is not allowed.
2. Advanced Features
Order of Operations (BODMAS/PEMDAS)

Description: The calculator respects the order of operations, ensuring that multiplication and division are performed before addition and subtraction.
Example:
Input: 2 + 3 * 4
Output: 14 (not 20, because multiplication is done first).
Floating-Point Arithmetic

Description: Supports operations on decimal numbers with precision.
Example:
Input: 5.5 + 2.3
Output: 7.8
3. Edge Cases and Error Handling
Division by Zero:

The calculator gracefully handles division by zero, returning an appropriate error message.
Example:
Input: 7 / 0
Output: Error: Cannot divide by zero.
Invalid Inputs:

Handles non-numeric inputs or malformed expressions by providing clear error messages.
Example:
Input: 5 + a
Output: Error: Invalid input.
4. User Interface and Output Display
Input Method:

Users can input numbers and operations through a graphical user interface (GUI) or a command-line interface (CLI).
Output Display:

The result of the calculation is displayed in a clear and concise manner, either on the GUI screen or in the terminal.
History and Logs:

The calculator may also provide a history of past calculations, allowing users to review or reuse previous results.
